# Quick start

## Install CLI

Install the `@node-cool/cli` package globally. With the CLI you'll be able to generate a `@node-cool` project quickly.

``` terminal
$ npm i -g @node-cool/cli
```

## Create project

Create a new project with the CLI.

``` terminal
$ node-cool new --name <project name>
```

This will generate a ready-to-go `@node-cool` project with example code in it.

## Build project

Once you've generated the project simply build it with the following command.

``` terminal
$ npm run build
```

## Run server

You can run your server with the following command.

``` terminal
$ cd dist
$ npm start
```
